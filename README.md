# TeachHub by lornasFanBois

## Introduction

Teachers across Australia teach the same curriculum. Each of them go home to do more work planning for their next lessons. This reduces the free-time teachers may have. Our idea helps solve this issue by allowing teachers to share and create lesson plans in one area where other teachers could use them. This would cut down the time teachers spend outside of class to prepare for future lessons.

## Concept

TeachHub aims to create a community in which teachers can communicate, share and discover teaching methods and resources, new technologies and how to use them. The application will mainly focus on asynchronous distributed interaction where teachers will create, post, reply in forums. The web application will allow teachers to create and share lesson plans and use ready-made plans across a range of subjects. Lesson plans will have a rating system included which will allow teachers to see how effective the plan is and whether or not it will suit their circumstances. Teachers will also be able to get advice on teaching methods and how to deal with trouble students through a forum provided by the website.

## Project Team

Judah Bennett (Multimedia Design) - Moral support,Front end, Logistics<br />
Ihsaan Mahomed (Multimedia Design) -  Designer, UX/UI, Content<br />
Digby Tilse (Multimedia Design) - Designer, User Testing, Programmer <br /><br />
The team will work collaboratively, and employ a diplomatic approach to decision making and idea generation and development. Trello will be used to list tasks that require completion. Group members will nominate tasks they wish to complete, and may employ their own work style in order to complete that task, providing the task is complete by the required deadline. Underperforming group members member will be notified of their underperformance and reminded of their responsibilities towards the group. If this does not resolve the issue, course teaching staff will be consulted in order to resolve the issue. The project will utilise a user-centred design approach, and as such most decisions will be made based on feedback received from users. Where decisions must be made by the group, a diplomatic majority approach will be adopted. Group members will vote on a desired solution, and the majority vote will Decisions will be made based on user feedback primarily, but where necessary the majority rules. Conflict will be resolved by trial by combat.
 
## Communication

The primary method of communication for the project will be Slack, with Google Docs and Drive used for collaboration and filestorage. File names will be meaningful (e.g. explain what the file is) and named in camelcase. These platforms have been chosen due to their familiarity (Google Drive), and integration with the course (Slack). Slack is a centralised service that is convenient for sharing many different types of media, and offers functionality that facilitates group collaboration (e.g. pinning important information, integration with Google Drive).
Trello will be used to keep fellow team members informed of what is being worked on. Tasks will be posed in Trello, and team members will indicate when they are working on that task. This will increase the efficiency and communication of the team.

### Milestone 1 <br />
Project Phase: Research<br />
_Concludes: Friday, Week 7 (08/09/17)_<br /><br />
Milestone 1 will be the research phase of the project, and result in foundational research that will inform the teams early prototypes, and assist the project team compile a list of pain points and gain generators for the target audience.
<br />

Key deliverables: <br />
* Solid foundational research from which to begin developing low fidelity prototypes for user testing.<br />
 <hr />

### Milestone 2

Project Phase: User Testing<br />
Standup: Tuesday, 12/09/17<br />
_Concludes: Friday, Week 8 (15/09/17)_<br /><br />

This milestone will include the project team presenting their progress. Currently, Milestone 2 is intended to be a rapid iteration of low-fidelity, horizontal prototyping and user testing. The goal of this milestone is to generate a design direction to being development of an electronic prototype. Through this approach, the project team plans to allow enough time to produce a strong, functional prototype for the Digital Showcase. <br />

Key deliverables: <br />
* User testing results from performing paper prototyping.
* A design direction that provides the project team with a starting point to begin development of an electronic prototype. <br /> 

<hr />

### Milestone 3
Project Phase: Development<br />
_Concludes: Friday, Week 9 (22/10/17)_<br /><br />

Build an actual web app - for testing. Functional testing?
Front end - done in actual HTML/JS ?f
Depending on the results of week 8 user testing create a Vertical Hi-fi prototype
<br />
Key deliverables:

<hr />

### Milestone 4 
Project Phase: Development<br />
_Concludes: Friday, Week 10 (06/10/17)_<br />
<br />
Finished product
Tasks:
UI Design
Simulation
User testing
Integration of user feedback
Tags: Tag your proposed idea with 5 key concepts from social and mobile lectures (e.g. awareness, Collaboration, CSCW) and 2 keywords related to your domain.

Possible keywords associated with domain: sharing, collaboration

Key Deliverable: Minimum Viable Product of the application

<hr />

### Milestone 5 
_Concludes: Friday, Week 11 (15/09/17)_<br /><br />
Perform another round of user testing for the final.



<hr />

### Milestone 6 
_Concludes: Friday, Week 12 (15/09/17)_<br /><br />
Project due 27/10/2017 <br />
This Milestone will aim to have the <span title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</span> of the system completed to a high standard. Promotional materials should be ready for feedback and finalisation at this point also. During this milestone final feedback will be gathered ready for final features and improvement by Milestone 7.

Key deliverable:
<br />
* <span title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</span> complete
* Draft promotional material ready for finalisation

<hr />

### Milestone 7
_Concludes: Wednesday, Week 13 (15/09/17)_<br />
Social and Mobile Showcase (4pm)

Key Deliverables: <br />
* An electronic prototype that performs key functionality free of bugs
* Promotional materials completed to a high and profressional standard

<hr />

### Milestone 7.5
_Concludes: Friday, Week 13 (15/09/17)_<br />
Final Delivery
