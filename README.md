## Introduction

Teachers across Australia teach the same curriculum. Each of them go home to do more work planning for their next lessons. This reduces the free-time teachers may have. Our idea helps solve this issue by allowing teachers to share and create lesson plans in one area where other teachers could use them. This would cut down the time teachers spend outside of class to prepare for future lessons.

## Concept

TeachHub aims to create a community in which teachers can communicate, share and discover teaching methods and resources, new technologies and how to use them. The application will mainly focus on asynchronous distributed interaction where teachers will create, post, reply in forums. The web application will allow teachers to create and share lesson plans and use ready-made plans across a range of subjects. Lesson plans will have a rating system included which will allow teachers to see how effective the plan is and whether or not it will suit their circumstances. Teachers will also be able to get advice on teaching methods and how to deal with trouble students through a forum provided by the website.

## Project Team

Judah Bennett (Multimedia Design) - Moral support,Front end, Logistics
Ihsaan Mahomed (Multimedia Design) -  Designer, UX/UI, Content
Digby Tilse (Multimedia Design) - Designer, User Testing, Back-end, Manager
The team will work via collaboration, run each of our own ideas by each other in order to build upon them. We will use Trello and work on the tasks required at our own leisure. If the rest of the group feels that anyone member is not contributing enough that said member will be kindly remind of their responsibilities towards the group and if that does not work someone with more authority will be consulted. Decisions will be made based on user feedback primarily, but where necessary the majority rules. Conflict will be resolved by trial by combat.
 
## Communication

The primary method of communication for the project will be Slack, with Google Docs and Drive used for collaboration and filestorage. File names will be meaningful (e.g. explain what the file is) and named in camelcase. These platforms have been chosen due to their familiarity (Google Drive), and integration with the course (Slack). Slack is a centralised service that is convenient for sharing many different types of media, and offers functionality that facilitates group collaboration (e.g. pinning important information, integration with Google Drive).
Trello will be used to keep fellow team members informed of what is being worked on. Tasks will be posed in Trello, and team members will indicate when they are working on that task. This will increase the efficiency and communication of the team.

## Plan

Plan: Identify the key tasks that need to be completed and when. Identify: • Project phases e.g. research; requirements; design; construction; • Key deliverables for each phase (Milestones) ; 2 • Resources – equipment or other tools/people you might need. 
Milestone 1 - Friday, Week 7 (08/09/17)
paper prototyping done. Then integrate the feedback for the hi-fi prototype, simulate that and get feedback from Education students.
Milestone 2 - Friday, Week 8 (15/09/17)
Standup no. 1 will take place this week on 12/09
Research - interviews and information gathering
Idea refinement and finalisation
Paper prototyping - performed and feedback integrated into the system
Testing protocol - basic
Key Deliverables:
Horizontal Hi-fi prototype that has been tested and has had feedback implemented (basically we have already performed one iteration of our product and acted on one round of feedback
Milestone 3 (Week 9 - date)
Build an actual web app - for testing. Functional testing?
Front end - done in actual HTML/JS ?
Depending on the results of week 8 user testing create a Vertical Hi-fi prototype
Key deliverables:
Draft web application that simulates key functionality 

Milestone 4 (Week 10 - date)

Finished product
Tasks:
UI Design
Simulation
User testing
Integration of user feedback
Tags: Tag your proposed idea with 5 key concepts from social and mobile lectures (e.g. awareness, Collaboration, CSCW) and 2 keywords related to your domain.

Possible keywords associated with domain: sharing, collaboration

Key Deliverable: Minimum Viable Product of the application

Milestone 5 - (Week 11)
Perform another round of user testing for the final.

Milestone 6 - (Week 12)
Project due 27/10/2017
